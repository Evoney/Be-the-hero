```bash
# install the dependencies
cd mobile
yarn
```

In order to run the application on your device, you need to change the ip config.

[api.js](https://github.com/Evoney/Be-the-hero)
```javascript
  baseURL: 'http://192.168.0.235:3333',
```
replace 192.168.0.235 with your machine's ip.

Now with everything on place, run the application.

```bash

# to run the app
npm start

```
Expo will open a page in your browser, scan the QRcode on the page and wait for the app to load.

> The Application was developed and tested on Samsung J4
